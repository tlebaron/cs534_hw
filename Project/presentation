/!\ replace print "" by print("")

Do this one
-classes
-categorize the constraints in 3 typess
-AC3 after each iteration: need modify to allow the backtracking
	- constraint propagation return the removes possible assignments
	- backtracking reinsert the removed possible assignment when backtrack 


- how to make the bonus:
	- create a uniform constraint for total price
	- start at zero. while there is no solution, increment the price
	- our result
